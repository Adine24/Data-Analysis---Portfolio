---Answers to Data Questions---

1a. Predictive analytics uses historical data to predict future events. Typically, historical data is used to build a mathematical model that captures important trends. That predictive model is then used on current data to predict what will happen next, or to suggest actions to take for optimal outcomes.

1b. Popular predictive analytics models include classification, clustering, and time series models.

1c. Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers, uses predictive analytics to optimize inventory management. They analyze historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and external factors like weather to forecast demand accurately.

2a. An example of descriptive analytics include KPIs such as year-on-year percentage sales growth, revenue per customer and the average time customers take to pay bills.

2b. Descriptive analytics focuses on exploring and summarizing historical data to understand what has happened in the past.

3a. It often follows descriptive analytics, which focuses on what has happened in the past. Diagnostic analytics relies on information from descriptive analytics to proceed, as you need to know what happened before you can ask why it happened. 

3b. A marketing team might perform diagnostic analytics to find out why a campaign, website, or social media post saw an engagement increase, or why their company is experiencing a declining click-through rate.

4a. Prescriptive analytics specifically factors information about possible situations or scenarios, available resources, past performance, and current performance, and suggests a course of action or strategy. It can be used to make decisions on any time horizon, from immediate to long-term.

4b.By employing prescriptive analytics, marketers can come up with effective campaigns that target specific customers at specific times like, say, advertising for a certain demographic during the Superbowl. Corporations can also identify how to engage different customers and how to effectively price and discount their products and services.

4c. Prescriptive analytics builds upon the three other types of data analytics which describe the present and make predictions about the future. It then uses heuristics, machine learning and rule-based systems to make specific recommendations based on data and probability-weighted projections

5a. Primary data refers to the first hand data gathered by the researcher himself. Secondary data means data collected by someone else earlier.

6a. Internal data is private data collected within the organization from departments like sales, finance, human resource, and marketing to help in making decisions for the organization. External data is data collected and processed from outside the organization.

6b. Traditional external data is frequently used to complement internal sources for a better understanding of the selected market or to monitor macro trends or consumer behavior. 

7a. Quantitative data refers to any information that can be quantified, counted or measured, and given a numerical value, Quantitative research is based on numeric data.. Qualitative data is descriptive in nature, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values. 

7b. Qualitative data is more useful than quantitative data in situations where: Understanding personal experiences, opinions, and attitudes is important. Exploring new and complex ideas or issues. Gathering detailed and rich information to inform decision-making.

8a. Discrete and continuous variables are two types of quantitative variables: Discrete variables represent counts (e.g. the number of objects in a collection). Continuous variables represent measurable amounts (e.g. water volume or weight).

8b. Discrete data is useful when counting or measuring exact quantities is important, and it can be used to track changes over time. Continuous data, however, can take on any value within a certain range, such as the weight of employees in a company or the sales revenue of a business.

9a. Unstructured data typically poses two big challenges: 
   i) Storage because the data is typically larger than structured data. 
   ii) Analysis because it's not as straightforward as analyzing structured data.

9b. They can be useful when you're conducting surveys and need to analyze the results. Nominal scales group by category, while ordinal surveys arrange data in a specific order. Depending on the type of data your analyzing, and your research questions, one scale may be more appropriate than another.

10a. A dataset is a structured collection of data generally associated with a unique body of work. A database is an organized collection of data stored as multiple datasets.

10b. Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier. Some examples include: Means of creation of the data. Purpose of the data.

10c. For example, you can create folders or subfolders based on metadata categories, such as project, client, department, or topic. You can also use metadata to rename your files in a consistent and meaningful way, such as using the title, date, and version number.
