--Problem Statement--

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They
want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product
offerings and reach in the financial market.

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and
approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However,
strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr.Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them
to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing them the full project.
They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their
online spend and other details.

Peter Pandey is a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services and asked by his manager
to take over this project. His role is to analyse the provided sample data and
report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is
expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and
market trends.

The successful acquisition of this project depends on Peter's ability to provide
actionable, data-driven recommendations and impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his
team. Peter requested support from his manager Tony Sharma, and he
provided him with some ideas to generate insights based on the data
provided.

  -Surprisingly Business owners who are the Top average income earners have a 12.19% utilization but when compared to the total spend, they have a high total spend regardless of the utilization %

  -Freelancers dont earn as much as business owners on average, but they have a high utilization of 20.88%, but low total spend

--Discussions--

The Dashboard provided can be used to filter certain information in order to gain more insights with respect to the filter. For example, Customer ID filter is present and can be used to filter the total spend for each customer, their average pay and in which month they spend more.

For the purpose of this project analysis my focus is on Credit Cards.

Credit Card being the most used payment type across all demographics and spending areas, this gives Mitron Bank a good advantage for the launch of theirs.

Credit cards are used more age within groups 25-34
Credit cards are used more by Salaried IT Employees
Credit cards are used more in Mumbai
Credit cards are used more to settle bills and pay groceries at the store

But in order for customers to choose Mitron Banks Card I would recommend that they:

1. Offer better maintainace rate on their cards. This can make more people pick up the use of the new card.

2. Introduce welcome offers for registering a new card.

3. Introduce a rewards-earning rate for their cards.

4. Pick up an Annual Percentage Rate for amount of money in their card yearlty.

5. Introduce a benefit for business owners and salaried IT employees as they constitute the highest spenders.

6. Introduce a discount for payment on the bills and groceries category as they constitute the category that are spent on more.

--Conclusion--

In conclusion Mitron Bank going for new credit cards is a nice idea as majority of people already make use of it for their payment. But to stand out from their competitors I would advice they follow the six recommendations I have discussed to gain an edge in the market.
